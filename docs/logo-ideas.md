# Logo ideas

- Concept: start from “Meet Up” lettering and strike through the second “e” so it reads “Meat Up,” playing up the tongue-in-cheek theme.
- Draft vector: `public/logo-meat-up.svg` uses white “MEET / UP” text with a skewed, brush-stroked electric-red “A” painted over (but still revealing) the second “E” to land on “Meat Up,” positioned slightly higher for better balance.
