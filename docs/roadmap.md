- Add-to-calendar (ICS + Google/Apple) and shareable social cards
- Event reminders/digests via email or web push notifications

## Rich Content
- Expanded event pages: photo gallery, speaker bios, session schedule
- Highlight recurring series and featured/hero events
- “Similar events” recommendations

## Community & Feedback
- Attendee list previews (avatars/names) with privacy-safe defaults
- Comments/questions per event; simple voting on future topics/locations
- Organizer profiles with past and upcoming events

## Conversion & Growth
- Referral links and promo codes
- Newsletter signup plus archive of past events/recaps
- UTM-aware analytics to track acquisition channels

## Ops & Reliability
