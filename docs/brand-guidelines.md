# Meat Up // Design Guidelines & Manifesto

> **The vibe:** Neo-brutalist, loud, high-contrast, raw, and industrial. A digital smokehouse meeting a disruptive tech platform. It must feel urgent, overwhelming in a positive way, and unapologetic about its subject matter. **No salads allowed.**

## 1. Core Principles

1.  **Typography is Image:** Text is not just for reading; it is the primary visual element. Headlines must be massive, condensed, and dominate the viewport.
2.  **No Softness Allowed:** Abolish gradients, blurred shadows, rounded corners (unless deliberately pill-shaped with a hard border), and delicate hairlines. Everything has hard edges, distinct black borders, and visible grids.
3.  **The Palette Constraint:** Stick rigidly to the defined four-color palette. Do not deviate.
4.  **Raw Imagery:** Photography must be high-texture, high-contrast, and preferably Black & White to clash against the loud UI colors. Focus on the grain of the meat, smoke, and metal tools.

## 2. Visual Identity

### The Logo
The primary logo is the **"MU" T-Bone**.
* A stylized white outline of a thick T-Bone steak slab.
* The internal marbling and bone shapes are clever negative space forming the initials 'MU'.
* *Usage:* Typically placed top-left on solid color backgrounds (usually Red).

### Color Palette

| Swatch | Role | Name | Hex Code | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ██████ | Primary Brand | Electric Red | `#E04F5F` | Used for large background fills and accents. |
| ██████ | Action / CTA | Mustard Yellow | `#FFDB58` | Exclusively for high-priority buttons and highlights. |
| ██████ | Text / Borders | Carbon Black | `#000000` | Used for all typography, thick borders, and flat shadows. |
| ██████ | Background / Text | Stark White | `#FFFFFF` | Used for secondary backgrounds or text against dark images. |

### Typography Style

* **Headlines:** Massive, Extra-Condensed, Bold, Sans-Serif, All-Caps. (Think woodblock posters or industrial warnings).
    * *Usage:* Hero headers, page titles, major visual statements.
* **Subtitles & Body:** Functional, clean, bold mono-weight sans-serif. All-caps preferred for UI elements; sentence case acceptable for longer descriptions.

### Imagery Style
* **Content:** Close-ups of raw cuts, smoked bark, glistening fat, cleavers, butcher blocks, and smoke.
* **Treatment:** High-contrast Black & White. Gritty textures must be emphasized. Images often sit opposite solid blocks of Electric Red.

## 3. UI Components & Layout Rules

### The "Slab" CTA Button
Buttons are not mere rectangles; they are heavy slabs demanding interaction.
* **Fill:** Mustard Yellow (`#FFDB58`).
* **Border:** Thick (4px+) solid Carbon Black border.
* **Typography:** Massive, bold, black, all-caps text filling the container.
* **Shadows (Optional):** Hard, flat, black drop shadow offset to the bottom right. No blurs.

### Borders & Dividers
* All elements, cards, and sections should be separated by thick, hard black lines. Think industrial blueprint grids rather than subtle UI separators.

### Layout Structures
* **The Split Screen:** Use vertical 50/50 splits for hero sections or major feature highlights. One side solid color + typography, the other side raw B&W imagery (as seen in the homepage hero).
* **The Industrial Grid:** Event lists and card layouts should feel heavy and structured, like a wall of gig posters.

## 4. Feature Concepts & Implementation Guide

### The Event List ("Upcoming Feasts")
* **Concept:** A butcher's job board. Urgent and heavy.
* **Execution:**
    * Entries are heavy rectangular "slabs" with thick borders.
    * The DATE is massive and vertical on the left edge of the card.
    * Hard-edged yellow CTA button on every card ("DETAILS").

### Single Event Page ("The Cutting Board")
* **Concept:** An industrial manifest or boxing fight card. Hype the main course.
* **Execution:**
    * Utilize the Split-Screen layout. Left side: Giant B&W photo of the main meat. Right side: Solid red background with logistical details in a massive checklist format.
    * The "RSV-PORK" button should be sticky at the bottom of the viewport on mobile.

### Ratings ("The Meat-o-Meter")
* **Concept:** Industrial gauges, not delicate stars.
* **Execution:**
    * Replace 5-star scales with visceral text ranges: "RARE AF" (5/5) down to "BURNT HOCKEY PUCK" (1/5).
    * Visualized using thick, chunky, horizontal progress bars with heavy black outlines.

### User Profile ("The Butcher's Apron")
* **Concept:** A merit badge sash for serious carnivores. Bragging rights.
* **Execution:**
    * Badges are aggressive, angular shield shapes with thick black outlines and flat brand colors.
    * Profile header texture should resemble a grease-stained butcher block or apron.
